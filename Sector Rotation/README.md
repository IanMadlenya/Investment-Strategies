# Investment-Strategies

This strategy implements Marc Faber's Sector Rotation strategy.
 
Sector Rotation based trading strategies are popular because they can 
improve risk-adjusted returns and automate the investing process. Momentum 
investing, which is at the heart of the sector rotation strategy, seeks to 
invest in sectors showing the strongest performance over a specific timeframe. 
Momentum investing is another form of relative strength investing.   

Chartist must then decide how much capital to allocate to each sector and to the strategy as a whole. Chartists could buy the top three sectors and allocate equal amounts to all three (33%). Alternatively, investors could implement a weighted strategy by investing the most in the top sector and lower amounts in the subsequent sectors.

Buy Signal: When the S&P 500 is above its 10-month simple moving average, buy the sectors with the biggest gains over a three month timeframe.

Sell Signal: Exit all positions when the S&P 500 moves below its 10-month simple moving average on a monthly closing basis.

Rebalance: Once per month, sell sectors that fall out of the top tier (three) and buy the sectors that move into the top tier (three).
