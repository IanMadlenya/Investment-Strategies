# Experation Roll Yield
This program is designed to find the first month expiration date as well as the second month expiration date.  It is then designed to find the days left in the first month and the number of days within the second month.  This creates a rolling effect so as one day 
gets subtracted from the first month it is then added to the second month to create a weighted average.  The days in each month do not include weekends or holidays.

"VIX was designed to be a consistent, 30-day benchmark of expected market volatility, as measured by SPX option prices. Of course, there is only one day in the life of any option that is exactly 30 days to expiration, so in order to arrive at the 30-day standard, VIX is calculated as a weighted average of options expiring on two different dates. 

One day each month, on the Wednesday that is thirty days prior to the third Friday of the following calendar month, the SPX options expiring in exactly 30 days account for all of the weight in the VIX calculation. VIX options settle on these Wednesdays in order to facilitate the special opening procedures that establish opening prices for those SPX options used to calculate the exercise settlement value for VIX options." 

Here is a list of all VIX options expiration dates through December 2015.
Please note: trading will cease on the business day before the expiration date.
